# Tiny-C-Experiments
Small 1-night C/C++ experiments.

### MyFirstRPG scene

Very quick attempt at creating a small RPG to test sprite movement and some layer rendering using SFML.


### Perspective Shift

While making the above RPG test I was inspired to play around with some effects to create a 3D illusion using 2D images as seen in many games - the purpose for this particular illusion may be used in bird's-eye-view perspective games
